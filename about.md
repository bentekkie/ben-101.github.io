One year in university I made a bet that I would do 101 hours of torah study in the next year.

I am not sure if I lived up to that in that year, but over the past several years I have been learning a lot of Torah from a lot of different people.

I orginally got this domain when I made that bet to record what I was learning. Now I will start.
